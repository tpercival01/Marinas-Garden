# **Marina's Digital Garden**

An interactive full-stack web application built with Python, Flask, and JavaScript that allows users to manage a virtual garden. The application features a persistent database, a complete RESTful API for all plant operations, and is served by a production-grade Gunicorn server.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project demonstrates a full-stack architecture, separating concerns between the backend API and the frontend UI.

| Category      | Technology                                      |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**  | `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript (ES6+)`            |
| **Backend**   | `Python 3`, `Flask`                             |
| **Database**  | `SQLite` / `PostgreSQL`, `SQLAlchemy` (ORM)     |
| **API**       | `RESTful`, `JSON`                               |
| **Deployment**| `Gunicorn` (WSGI Server)                        |

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete plants in their garden.
-   **RESTful API:** A complete API backend handles all data manipulation. All communication between the front-end and back-end is done asynchronously via `fetch()` requests.
-   **Persistent Data Storage:** Plant data is stored in a SQLite database and managed with the SQLAlchemy ORM, ensuring user data is saved across sessions.
-   **Dynamic UI:** The front-end is built with vanilla JavaScript and manipulates the DOM to provide a seamless, real-time user experience without page reloads.
-   **Self-Contained & Served:** The application is served as a single unit by a production-ready Gunicorn server, with Flask handling both API requests and the rendering of the front-end application.
