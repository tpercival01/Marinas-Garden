# **Marina's Digital Garden**

Marina's Digital Garden is an interactive web application that allows users to create and manage a virtual garden while tracking the care of their real-life plants. Users can click on empty plots of land to add plants, input basic details, and let the system fetch care information automatically. The app is designed to be both functional and engaging, with a clean, pixel-art-inspired aesthetic and a focus on simplicity and customization.
